```
# Variables in class

- **Local Variables** - They are the variables that are defined in a method and are not availiable outside that method.They always begins with small letter or '_'.
- **Instance Variables** - They are available across methods for any particular instance or object.They are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.
- **Class Variables** - A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.
- **Global Variables** - Global variables are availiable across the class.The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).

# Objects
- Objects are instances of the class.
- Ruby uses new method to create an object.

``` obj = ClassName.new ```
